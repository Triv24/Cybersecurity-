# The Linux Operating System : 

## What will you learn in this module :
1. The architecture of linux
2. Different distributions of linux
3. The shell

## Linux :
- Open-Source OS
- Linux and other programs that come with licensed under the terms of the GNU Public License, which allow you to :
  - use
  - share
  - modify freely

- There are over 600 distributions of linux

- you will use Linux to verify access and authorization in an `identity and access management system`.

## Linux Architecture :

### Components of Linux :
- **User** - person using the system. Linux is multi-user
- **Applications** --  a program that performs a specific task [eg. Nano]
> Nano is a text editor
> Linux applications are commonly distributed through package managers.
> A package manager is a tool that helps users install, manage, and remove packages or applications.
> A package is a piece of software that can be combined with other packages to form an application.
- **Shell** - it is command line interpreter
- **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard** - organises data. It is a way to organise data so that it can be found when the data is accessed by the system.
- A **directory** is a file that organizes where other files are stored.
- Directories are sometimes called “**folders**,” and they can contain files or other directories. The FHS defines how directories, directory contents, and other storage is organized so the operating system knows where to find specific data. 
- **Kernel** - manages processes and memory.
  - communicates with hardware to execute commands sent by the shell.
  - The kernel uses drivers to enable applications to execute tasks.
  - The Linux kernel helps ensure that the system allocates resources more efficiently and makes the system work faster.
- **Hardware** - physical components of a computer.[eg. CP, Mouse]

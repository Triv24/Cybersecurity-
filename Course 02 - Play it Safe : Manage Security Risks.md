# Module 01 : 

### NIST's Risk Management Framework :
- Prepare : Activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs.
- CAtegorise : Used to develop risk management processes and tasks.
- Select : Choose, customise and capture documentation of the controls that protects an organisation. 
- Implement : Implement security and privacy plans for the organisation
- Assess : Determine if established controls are implemented correctly.
- Authorise : Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organisation.
- Monitor : Be aware of how systems are operating. 

 # Module 02 :

 ### Security Framework :
 - Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.

### Controls :
- Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
- 3 common types of controls :
    1. Encryption - Process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format.
      - Encryption involves converting data from plain text to cipher text.
     
      > Cipher text is a raw and encoded message that is unreadable to humans and computers. 
    
    2. Authentication -  Process of verifying who someone or something is.
         - MFA -- Multi-Factor Authentication : Use face scan or biometrics or something more from user to prove who he claims to be.

      > Biometrics : Unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person's identity. Examples : Fingerprints, eye scan, palm scan.

  - **Vishing :**  The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensiive information or to impersonate a known source. 
  
    3. Authorisation - Authorization refers to the concept of granting access to specific resources within a system. Essentially, authorization is used to verify that a person has permission to access a resource.
  
## Specific frameworks and controls :

- There are many different frameworks and controls that organizations can use to remain compliant with regulations and achieve their security goals.

-  Frameworks covered in this reading are :
    -  Cyber Threat Framework (CTF) 
    -  International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001.

### Cyber Threat Framework (CTF) :

- According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CTF was developed by the U.S. government to provide “a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.”

- By providing a common language to communicate information about threat activity, the CTF helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently.

- This allows organizations to improve their response to the constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape and threat actors' many tactics and techniques.

### International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001 :

- An internationally recognized and used framework is ISO/IEC 27001.
- The ISO 27000 family of standards enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties.
- This framework outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organization’s ability to manage risks.
- Although the ISO/IEC 27001 framework does not require the use of specific controls, it does provide a collection of controls that organizations can use to improve their security posture.

### Controls :

- Controls are used alongside frameworks to reduce the possibility and impact of a security threat, risk, or vulnerability.
- Controls can be physical, technical, and administrative and are typically used to prevent, detect, or correct security issues.

**Examples of physical controls:**

- Gates, fences, and locks
- Security guards
- Closed-circuit television (CCTV), surveillance cameras, and motion detectors
- Access cards or badges to enter office spaces

**Examples of technical controls:**

- Firewalls
- MFA
- Antivirus software

**Examples of administrative controls:**

- Separation of duties
- Authorization
- Asset classification

a variety of threat types, review the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’
